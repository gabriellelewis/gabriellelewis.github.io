        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had immediate effects on everyone in the United States, from throwing many into social isolation to taking away valuable sources of income and people’s lives — and the LGBTQ population is no exception.</p>
        <p>Over the past year during the pandemic, many studies have come out detailing the obstacles LGBTQ Americans face which would make the pandemic disproportionately affect them.</p>
        <p>The Human Rights Campaign released an <a href="https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/assets/resources/COVID19-IssueBrief-032020-FINAL.pdf?mtime=20200811115717&focal=none" target="_blank">issue brief</a> last year explaining many of the unique challenges within the LGBTQ community. Since LGBTQ Americans work in industries highly affected by the pandemic, about 5 million jobs were more likely to face consequences. The brief also included overviews of how LGBTQ Americans are more likely to live in poverty and have respiratory issues, as well as how LGBTQ youth are more likely to be homeless. </p>
        <p>The challenges coming with this pandemic haven't just disproportionately affected the livelihoods within the community — they also exacerbated mental health issues by adding other stressors on top of LGBTQ-related ones.</p>

    <p>Before the pandemic, LGBTQ individuals already faced higher risks of mental health issues. LGBTQ youth are more likely than non-LGBTQ youth to struggle with their mental health, and LGBTQ adults are also more likely to have mental health or substance use issues, according to an <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/LGBTQ_MentalHealth_OnePager.pdf" target="_blank">issue brief</a> from the HRC. These higher rates of mental health issues can be attributed to the stigma and discrimination surrounding the LGBTQ community.</p>
    <p>On top of these preexisting risks, the pandemic added a plethora of stressors, such as social isolation, unemployment and the loss of loved ones. A national <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/26375/LGBTQ_COVID_Report_09032020.pdf?sequence%3D3%26isAllowed%3Dy&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619717798112000&usg=AOvVaw0QydxfSiMzv6kL600k7Olk" target="_blank">survey</a> of LGBTQ college students during the pandemic found large numbers of students struggling with substance abuse, social isolation and psychological distress, as well as a lack of emotional support during the pandemic.</p>

    <p>John Salerno, a behavioral and community health doctoral student at the University of Maryland who led the survey, said LGBTQ students also face minority stressors related to their LGBTQ identity. These include stigma and discrimination or family rejection and abuse while staying home during the pandemic because their identity isn’t accepted.</p>
    <p>“We are already starting sort of at a disadvantage,” Salerno said. “LGBTQ persons are at risk because they have ... things that are related to their sexual and gender identities that can further affect their mental health, that heterosexual people just cannot experience because that's not part of their minds.”</p>
    <p>Although the pandemic has worsened mental health for LGBTQ people, it may not mean an increase in seeking out mental health services. Salerno said that LGBTQ people are more likely to pursue mental health services in schools, including university settings. Because many university students have had to live at home during this pandemic, they lost their connection to their mental health services, including LGBTQ students.</p>
    <p>“There's also the issue of privacy,” Salerno said. “If you’re receiving services online, are you still able to maintain that privacy you had when you were away from home in college?”</p>
    <p>At the University of Maryland’s counseling center, the number of LGBTQ students seeking out mental health services and mental health support systems, such as the center’s workshops, has dropped from the 2019-20 academic year to this current academic year.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="f15d9913-623d-449b-9ba9-fb471138d5ae" data-type="interactive" data-title=""></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"></a></div>
    <p>Salerno said a reason for this drop could be the possible lack of confidentiality for LGBTQ students using online services — but another reason could be the fact that everyone, both clients and therapists alike, are still learning how to navigate and engage in online services.</p>
    <p>Even with all these consequences to mental health, that doesn’t mean there aren’t solutions.</p>
    <p>The survey led by Salerno illustrated ways university leadership could help its LGBTQ student population. One recommendation was to collect data on students’ sexual orientation and gender identity to identify and address LGBTQ students’ needs. Another was to provide mental health services, such as chat or text-based services, which preserve LGBTQ students’ privacy and safety if they have not come out to their families.</p>
    <p>Salerno said something the government could do to help LGBTQ mental health is acknowledging the unique mental health challenges already facing the community and working to accommodate those individuals as the pandemic exacerbated those stressors.</p>
    <p>That’s something Salerno says universities should do, too, to better help their LGBTQ student populations.</p>
    <p>“I've seen that from the University of Maryland, and that's what I think all universities need to do,” Salerno said. “They need to acknowledge that LGBTQ students are here. They have unique needs, what are those needs, and how can we change and improve our services to help address those needs.”</p>
